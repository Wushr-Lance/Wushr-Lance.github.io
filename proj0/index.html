        <h1>Project 0: Becoming Friends with Your Camera</h1>
        <!-- <p>
            This project is about getting an intuitive understanding of the relationship between perspective, focal length, and the center of projection. Here are the results of my photographic experiments.

        <h2>Part 1: Selfie - The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
        <p>I took a picture of myself from close up, resulting in a distorted selfie. Then, I stepped back, zoomed in, and took a second picture to get a much better portrait.</p>

            <div class="photo-item">
                <img src="./media/part1-1.png" alt="A distorted selfie taken from close up">
                <p>Wrong Way (Close-up)</p>

            <div class="photo-item">
                <img src="./media/part1-2.png" alt="A better portrait taken from a distance with zoom">
                <p>Right Way (Distance + Zoom)</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
        <p>I repeated the same procedure for a street scene (the street is behind the bag and the fence). I took a photo from a distance with zoom, and then walked closer to take a second photo without zoom. The street in the first picture looks flattened compared to the second one.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
        <p>To duplicate the classic "Vertigo shot," I simultaneously moved the camera back and zoomed in while keeping the size of the stone unchanged. I then combined them into the GIF below.</p>
